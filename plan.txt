Train the X-Ray detection Model and Save this model as pickle
    1) Get the Data
    2) Read the Data inti python
    3) Prepare the data which sklearn's model accepts
    4) Train the model
    5) Save the model
 
 Build a flask webapp which uses that model
    1) HTML Page which accepts inage as input
    2) Image will be read in the backend
    3) It will be pre-processed
    4) Finally model will be used to make the predictions
